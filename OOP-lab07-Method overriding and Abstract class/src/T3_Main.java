//Lab Task 3
//Create an abstract class that stores data about the shapes e.g. Number of Lines in a Shape, Pen Color,
//Fill Color and an abstract method draw. Implement the method draw for Circle, Square and Triangle
//subclasses, the better approach is to draw these figures on screen, if you canâ€™t then just use a display
//message in the draw function.
