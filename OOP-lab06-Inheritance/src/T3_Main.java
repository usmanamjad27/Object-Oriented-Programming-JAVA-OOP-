//Lab Task 3
//Write a base class Computer that contains data members of word_size(in bits), memory_size (in megabytes),
//storage_size (in megabytes) and speed (in megahertz). Derive a Laptop class that is a kind of computer but
//        also specifies the objectâ€™s length, width, height, and weight. Member functions for both classes should
//include a default constructor, a constructor to initialize all components and a function to display data
//members.
