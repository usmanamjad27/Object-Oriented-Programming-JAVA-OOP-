/**
 *
 * @author Q:
 Suppose you operate several hot dog stands distributed throughout town. Define an Encapsulated class
named HotDogStand that has an instance variable for the hot dog standâ€™s ID number and an instance
variable for how many hot dogs the stand has sold that day.
Create a constructor that allows a user of the class to initialize both values. Also create a method named
justSold that increments by one the number of hot dogs the stand has sold. The idea is that this method
will be invoked each time the stand sells a hot dog so that you can track the total number of hot dogs sold
by the stand.
Write a main method to test your class with at least three hot dog stands that each sell a variety of hot
dogs. Use get function to display the hot dogs sold for each object.
